In Packet Tracer, basic networks are set up using computers and switches, with the configuration of various VLANs and the implementation of a native VLAN.

The accompanying PDF provides a detailed guide.

Basic Topology: A simple topology is created with four computers and one switch. There is a single network, and IP addresses are assigned to ensure full connectivity between all devices.

Subnetting and VLANs: Two VLANs are created using subnetting.

Trunk Links: Two switches are added, and additional VLANs are created. Trunk links are implemented between the switches.

Telnet Management: A third switch is added to the topology. Telnet is configured to manage all three switches from a specific VLAN.
